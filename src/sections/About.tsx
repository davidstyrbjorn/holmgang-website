                    StoneTech Games is a team of friends that started developing
                    games together during their studies at Link√∂ping University.
                    With a few smaller projects and gamejams under their belts
                    they are excited to create a larger, more complete
                    experience with Atganga. The name StoneTech Games comes from
                    an inside joke about a certain, very unique playstyle in
                    Atganga. Below you can find a small presentation for each
                    individual StoneTech Games developer.
